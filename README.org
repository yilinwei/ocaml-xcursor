* xcursor

xcursor is a pure implementation of the ~xcursor~ format which is used to parse cursors for both X and Wayland.

** Examples

Exampes are found in the ~./examples~ directory.

*** wayland_example

Creates a wayland surface which sets the cursor on entry. The first argument is a path to the cursor file to use.
An example cursor file is bundled in the project under ~./test/Adwaita/cursors/pointer~.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    dune exec example/wayland_example.exe -- ./test/Adwaita/cursors/pointer
#+END_SRC
